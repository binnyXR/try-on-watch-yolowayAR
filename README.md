This is an example of a DeepAR web ad with a carousel for multiple effects with image & video recording and sharing.

To develop an it helps to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can use any text editor to edit the files. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To run the development server, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then, run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
    npm install
    npm run build (only the first time)
    npm run start
```

To build the ad, run the following command:

```bash
    npm run build
```

The built ad will be in the `dist` directory.

You can then deploy the ad to any static web server, such as an AWS S3 bucket.
